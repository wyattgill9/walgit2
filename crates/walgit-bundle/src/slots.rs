//! Calendar-slot scheduling with backfill.
//!
//! A strategy's cron expression defines **slots** (its fire times). Each
//! slot gets exactly one bundle whose content is the ref state *as of the
//! slot time* (the WAL seq whose entries were created at or before it) and
//! whose `creation_token` is the slot's epoch seconds — deterministic, so
//! backfilled slots sort correctly even when built out of order, and git's
//! `creationToken` heuristic downloads exactly the bundles newer than what it
//! has. A maintainer pass computes every slot from the chain's anchor to now
//! and builds the **missing** ones oldest first (holes from downtime get
//! filled); `backfill_max` bounds one pass.
//!
//! Chain: an incremental slot's prerequisite is the newest bundle of its base
//! strategy with slot ≤ this slot (a daily after a new weekly restarts from
//! it). Retention is a contiguous chain (see [`retain`]).
