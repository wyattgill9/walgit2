# walgit — architecture and operating manual for contributors (humans and agents)

Context: **everyone, first.** Read this before touching the repository: the constraints the design answers
(§1), how the WAL works (§2), the principles a PR is judged against (§3), every design decision in force (§4),
and the working rules (§5). Reading order starts at `GOAL.md`; §0 maps every other document.

> **No backwards compatibility (pre-1.0).** We owe nothing to previous shapes of this system. Do not keep
> aliases, fallbacks, shims, deprecated routes, old config keys, old proto fields or migration code. When a
> decision changes the shape, **delete the old shape in the same change**: routes, clients, tests, docs, config
> keys. Data in the bucket is the one exception — WAL/manifest/log formats stay append-only and replayable,

walgit serves git over smart HTTP (v0/v2), receive-pack, upload-pack, LFS and a browsing web UI,
written in Rust, from disposable hosts whose only durable state is an object-store bucket. The reference workload
it was built against is a 57 GiB / 73 M-object / 1.4 M-commit / 466 k-ref monorepo with LFS, served from
machines whose "disk" is 20 GiB of tmpfs, next to a long tail of small repositories. The design follows Cursor's
*Git at any scale* (Continuity); `README.md` tells the story, this file keeps the rules.

## 0. Document map (one home per fact — link, don't duplicate)

| Doc | Who / when to read it |
|---|---|
| `GOAL.md` | Everyone, first. What walgit is for, the acceptance table, what we do not optimise for. |
| `AGENTS.md` (this) | Everyone. Constraints §1, WAL §2, principles §3, decisions §4, working rules §5. |
| `README.md` | The introduction: why (the Cursor lineage), what it does, how it works briefly, running it, invariants. |
| `docs/PACKFILE_URI_DESIGN.md` | Anyone implementing pack groups, proofs, lifecycle, or negotiated delivery. Design target; later layers require separate implementation and evidence. |
| `docs/PACKFILE_MIGRATION.md` | Bundle removal, saved settings, writer cutover, clients and rollout gates. |
| `docs/spec/README.md` | Bounded models, contract identifiers, result semantics, code/test map and remaining verification gaps. |
| `docs/ROUNDTRIPS.md` | **Anyone touching a protocol that talks to the bucket** (publish, sync, checkpoints, compaction/leases, remote reader, store backends). Round trips are the cost model; correct is not sufficient. |
| `docs/POLICY.md` | Anyone touching receive-pack authorization or writing a repo policy. Normative rule language. |
| `docs/LFS.md` | Anyone touching LFS (`lfs.rs`, `lfs_upstream.rs`) or importing a repository whose LFS history lives elsewhere. |
| `docs/INTEGRITY.md` | Anyone touching import, the maintainer's `fsck`/`repair` units, or seeing `connectivity: missing object` on a push. |
| `docs/EVENTS.md` | Anyone changing WAL-derived ref events, the webhook bridge, consumer semantics or event cursors. |
| `docs/CONTRACT.md` | When you touch a crate boundary. The cross-crate contract; *extend, don't rename*; code wins where they differ. |
| `docs/reference/cursor-git-at-any-scale.md` | The source design, verbatim. Read once before touching WAL/publish/sync/placement. |
| `web/API.md` | UI/SDK authors and anyone changing `web/*.rs`. Wire contract, caching rules, SSE envelope, tasks, prefix-first lanes. |
| `web/sdk/README.md` | Users of `repos.js`. |
| `web/README.md` | Frontend engineers changing the React SPA, Vite build, SDK adapter, static assets, loading states. |
| `walgit.example.toml` | Every config key with its default and a comment. Change it with the code. |
| `walgit.standalone.toml` | The one-machine shape: `walgit-server --config walgit.standalone.toml` → `https://walgit.localhost:8080/`. |
| `deploy/nginx.conf.example` | An optional nginx in front; documents the `X-Accel-Redirect` byte-offload contract. |
| `Containerfile`, `flake.nix` | An OCI image; a Nix package, image and devshell. |

## 1. Constraints we design for

### 1.1 The machine: small, ephemeral, shared-nothing
- Assume an instance of **a few vCPU and tens of GiB of memory where the disk *is* that memory** (tmpfs).
  `cache.max_bytes` (default 20 GiB) is the budget for everything on disk. A monorepo's base pack alone can be
  30+ GB: **it cannot be materialized there, ever.** A host with a real SSD (`cache.mode = "disk"`) is the
  exception, placed by configuration, not the rule.
- **Instances are ephemeral and shared-nothing**: no stable identity, no node-to-node networking, no gossip.
  Explicit placement (D30) decides which hosts perform a repository's object work; refs-level reads remain
  available everywhere, including during a deploy.
- **CPU may be throttled between requests** on serverless platforms; background work there must be bounded
  (`wal.prefetch_max_bytes`).
- **Object store facts**: ~60–80 ms per GET, ~100 MB/s per connection (stripe for more), conditional GET ~15 ms;
  same-object overwrite is serialized (~1 write/s) — a single CAS'd object is a throughput cap.
- Operations that need real disk or hours of CPU (a full `repack -adb` of a monorepo) run on a host with an SSD using the same binary and the same WAL/lease protocol (`walgit compact
  --base`, `walgit import`, the `maintain` role with `maintenance.disk = "ssd"`).

### 1.2 What follows
- **Never fully materialize a big repo on a small instance.** Serve from the parts that fit: refs from the WAL
  (ref snapshot + log tail), pack *indexes* + bitmaps + commit-graph locally, pack *data* by range read from the
  bucket (remote reader) or a read-only bucket mount, recent small packs locally. Negotiated reusable packs are the static delivery target; during the removal phase clone/fetch
  use dynamic upload-pack, subject to the existing bounded serving/placement limits.
- **An instance must become useful in seconds**, cold: refs in < 1 s (one manifest GET + snapshot + tail),
  objects for the web UI within the first request (remote reader), fetch remainders from local small packs.
- **Everything an instance computes that is immutable is cached for everyone**: in-process LRU and, where a
  second instance would otherwise recompute, the bucket itself (`cache/api/v1/*.json`). Wiping every instance
  loses nothing but warmth.
- **No silent waiting.** Long work is a *task* (id, log, lock, attachable stream) and is narrated to the
  client: SSE envelope for the web UI, sideband band-2 lines for git. "Cloning into… and then nothing" is a bug.

### 1.3 Security contract (`Config::validate` fails closed)
- Three auth modes (`server.auth.mode`): **`none`** (everyone is `anon` with write and admin — `validate` refuses unless `server.listen` is loopback),
  **`token`** (static tokens from the config, as `Authorization: Bearer` or an HTTP Basic password), **`oidc`**
  (any OpenID Connect issuer via discovery). In `oidc` mode `anonymous_read` must be false and an allowlist
  (`allowed_domains`/`allowed_emails`) must exist; three credentials are accepted — an ID token from the issuer
  (RS256/ES256, `iss`, `exp`, `aud` ∈ `audiences` ∪ {`oauth_client_id`}, `email_verified`), a **walgit access
  token** (`wgt_…`, HMAC-signed with `session_secret`, minted at `/_auth/tokens` by a signed-in browser, stateless,
  `access_token_ttl`; rotating the secret revokes all), and the HMAC **session cookie** set by `/_auth/login` →
  issuer → `/_auth/callback`. Static `tokens` work in `oidc` mode too (robots). Every path ends in the same
  allowlist and `write_domains`.
- Open at the application (no credential): `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/repos.js`, `/repos.mjs`, `/_auth/*` (the
  sign-in flow itself) and **`/services/public/*`** (data-free; today `install.sh` + `ca.pem`; everything else
  under it 404; never reads repo data or takes a bearer — test `public_lane_serves_only_the_installer_without_auth`).
- **The server answers an invalid/expired credential with a real 401** — that is what makes git `erase` it from
  its helpers and ask again; the friendly 200 + in-band ERR is reserved for failures a retry cannot fix (account
  not allowed, verifier down). A 200 leaves git re-storing a dead token for its cache's lifetime.
- **An edge announces what it took over, per request, in `X-Walgit-Capabilities`** (D39): `client-authorization`
  (the client's bearer travels in `X-Walgit-Authorization`; `Authorization` is the hop's own credential and is
  never read as the client's) and `accel-redirect` (static bytes by `X-Accel-Redirect`, honoured only when
  `server.accel_redirect = true` **and the TCP peer is loopback**). Hit directly, nothing is assumed.
- **The installer** (`crates/walgit-server/src/setup.rs`, POSIX sh, idempotent): git ≥ 2.46 + curl; pins a
  self-signed host's CA; takes the token from `$WALGIT_TOKEN`, an already stored one, or the terminal (no terminal:
  exit 2 with the two things to do); writes `~/.config/git/<host>-token` (0600) and the credential helper
  `<host>-credential-helper` (`get` → `authtype=Bearer`; `store` keeps what git hands it; `erase` on a 401 deletes
  the token and names `/_auth/tokens`); sets exactly `credential.https://<host>.helper` = `""` then ours,
  `fetch.uriProtocols https`; self-tests
  (`/api/v1/me`, or `ls-remote` of `?repo=`). Recipes come from one place (`setup::Recipes`,
  `/services/setup.json`); the Clone menu, API page, overview and git error help render them.
- **Host to host**: a front that forwards pushes to a broker presents `wal.push_broker_token` (or
  `WALGIT_BROKER_TOKEN`); the broker lists it in `tokens` and its principal in `trusted_forwarders`, so the end
  user travels in `X-Walgit-Principal`.
- Tests never write the user's global git config (private `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, `tests/lib-auth.sh`).

### 1.4 Requirements (the bar)
- Full git surface: smart HTTP v0/v2, ls-refs with prefixes, fetch with filter/shallow/deepen/sideband-all,
  receive-pack (atomic, delete, tags, push options, report-status-v2),
  LFS batch/basic transfer, `<owner>/<repo>` namespaces. Every read on every instance is as fresh as a fetch:
  push acknowledged ⇒ the next request anywhere sees it.
- Cost must not scale with ref count on any hot path (O(1) `refs`, O(k) `resolve`, paged ref lists, prefix
  filtered advertisements) nor with pack size on a too-small instance.
- Target: large clones negotiate proven reusable packs plus the uncovered graph. The removal phase keeps
  ordinary dynamic transfer; it does not implement or certify this acceleration.
- Acceptance for the monorepo: cold instance serves `info/refs`/ls-refs/web `refs` in < 1 s; web UI renders
  main's tree/blob/commits without packs on disk; `git clone` + `git fetch` work against a tmpfs
  host; `clone --filter=blob:none --depth=1 --sparse --single-branch` in seconds (reference: 2075 s → 8 s).

---

## 2. The WAL — source of truth, and how we squeeze value out of it

### 2.1 Objects and the commit point (`repos/<owner>/<repo>/…`)
| Object | Role |
|---|---|
| `manifest.pb` | Tiny, **CAS-rewritten**: `head_seq`, live pack set `PackRef[]` (checksum, sizes, tier, has_rev/bitmap), log segments, checkpoint pointer, settings inline, `revision`, `updated_at`. **The linearization point.** Nothing is visible before its CAS; everything after is idempotent and replayable. |
| `log/<first_seq>.pb` | Immutable, uvarint-framed `LogEntry` frames: PUSH / REF_UPDATE (ref transaction + pack pointer), COMPACT (new pack, `supersedes[]`), CHECKPOINT, SETTINGS. Strictly increasing `seq`. One small object per publish batch. |
| `wal/<checksum>.pack/.idx/.rev/.bitmap/.commit-graph` | Immutable packs, content-addressed by pack checksum: push packs (tier 0), compaction outputs (tier 1), the base (tier 2, bitmap'd), plus the side-files a reader needs. |
| `checkpoints/<seq>/checkpoint.pb`, `refs.pb` | Folded state at `seq`: live pack set + full `RefSnapshot`. Cold start = snapshot + tail, never full replay. |
| `leases/<name>.pb` | CAS lease with TTL heartbeat: `compact`. The only cross-instance mutex. |
| `cache/api/v1/<sha1>.json` | Shared render cache of immutable web API answers. |
| `policy.json` | Per-repo push policy (rule language, not on the WAL). `docs/POLICY.md`. Missing = allow-all. |
| `fsck.pb` | Last connectivity audit (`FsckReport`), written by the maintainer's `fsck` unit, consumed by `repair` (`docs/INTEGRITY.md`). |
| `events/cursor.json` | Durable acknowledged WAL sequence of the events bridge; advanced only after the webhook acknowledged (D32). |
| `lfs/objects/<aa>/<bb>/<oid>` | LFS objects (sha256-addressed, immutable). Missing ones can be read through from `upstream.lfs` and persisted (`docs/LFS.md`). |
Schema `crates/walgit-proto/proto/walgit/v1/wal.proto`; GCS over gRPC, S3 (AWS SDK) and in-memory stores share
one contract suite (`crates/walgit-store/tests/contract.rs`, incl. compose).

### 2.2 Write path
receive-pack (ours, `walgit-git/src/receive.rs`) → index the pack locally (`git index-pack --stdin --fix-thin
--keep --rev-index --threads=0`, `--fsck-objects` when `wal.fsck_objects`) in a per-ingest scratch git dir (a
rejected push leaves nothing behind) → connectivity per config (`spawn_blocking`) → **push policy**
(`docs/POLICY.md`) → `pack PUT ∥ idx PUT ∥ log PUT` → **manifest CAS** (group commit per repo per instance,
`wal.batch_window`) → commit local ref txn → `ok` to the client. On 412: refetch, re-validate every old value
(moved ref ⇒ `ng`), re-seq, retry with jittered backoff. **Who writes (D28): the host that maintains a repo.**
Hosts that maintain nothing may forward receive-pack to a **push broker** (`wal.push_broker_url`) so one warm
writer batches the CAS; fallback to the local path if the broker is down. Publish is CAS-safe, so disjoint writer
sets are correct by construction; the broker is an optimization, never a dependency. Never ACK before the bucket
ACKs. **Upstream follow** (`walgit_server::follow`, D33) is the second writer shape: refs in a repo's `[upstream]
follow` are brought up to `upstream.git`'s by the maintaining host every `maintenance.follow_interval` through the
same ingest → connectivity → fast-forward → `publish_push` path, `principal = upstream`.

### 2.3 Read path — sync levels (`RepoHandle::sync_*`, `walgit-wal/src/handle.rs`, `sync.rs`)
Every request: conditional GET of `manifest.pb` (skippable for `wal.freshness_ttl`) → 304 serve / 200 apply.
| Level | Brings | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| **Refs** | checkpoint `RefSnapshot` + every log entry's ref txn → `packed-refs`. No packs. | `info/refs`, `ls-refs`, web `refs`/`resolve`/overview, read_log |
| **Serve** (`sync()`) | Refs + the pack set as the instance can hold it: tiers < 2 and the **history pack** (D18) local; a tier-2 base as side-files (idx/rev/bitmap/commit-graph layer) + `pack-<sha>.pack` linked into a read-only bucket mount (`cache.store_mount`) or **remote-served** without one; midx over history + base | upload-pack, receive-pack, prewarm |
| **Full** (`sync_full()`) | Refs + every live pack local (striped parallel range downloads); only for repos that fit | base rebuilds (`compact --base`), geometric compaction |
| **Objects** | Serve when the pack set fits `cache.max_bytes`, else Refs + **remote reader** → `ObjectAccess::{Local,Remote}` | web API object endpoints |
Long syncs register as tasks (`materialize`, `remote-index`) and stream progress; pack work runs on the **bulk
runtime** and never takes the refs phase's lock (D19). `check_fits` refuses to pull a pack set that cannot fit
(TooLarge → 503 / pkt ERR with a truthful resource/placement explanation). Local disk is a bounded LRU (`cache.max_bytes`,
`evict_idle_after`) in budget mode, watermark eviction in disk mode (D25).

### 2.4 Getting the most out of the WAL (the strategies)
- **Refs-first everything.** Ref advertisement, peeled tags (`RefUpdate.new_peeled` recorded by the writer so
  replicas advertise `^{}` without objects), web `refs`/`resolve` — all from snapshot + tail, no objects.
- **Remote-served bases + gix fetch engine**: at Serve level with no store mount and a pack set that does not fit,
  tier-2 bases are remote-served (`PackPlan::Remote`: commit-graph layer local, nothing else); `git fetch` then
  runs the gix engine (`upload_gix.rs`): commit-graph walk, tree diff, base objects faulted by range, streamed.
- **Remote reader for too-large repos** (`walgit-wal/src/remote.rs`): pack indexes local, data by 1 MiB range
  reads through a process-wide block LRU (`cache.remote_block_bytes`), incremental inflate, iterative delta
  resolution with a decoded-object LRU. The web API faults exactly the objects a git command will touch into the
  loose store (`web/objects.rs`) and runs unchanged `git` renderers. The same contract test runs with a 1-byte cache.
- **Side-files published with packs**: `.idx`, `.rev`, `.bitmap`, and for tier-2 bases a **split commit-graph
  layer** readers install as their chain base. Every pack writer produces `.rev` (`pack.writeReverseIndex`; git
  ≥ 2.47 on the server); a published pack ≥ 250 k objects without one gets it from the maintainer (`rev-index`
  unit) — without it git rebuilds the reverse index in memory on every `pack-objects` (2.85 s per fetch on a
  60 M-object repository).
- **Checkpoints fold the log** when `wal.snapshot_every_entries` OR `wal.checkpoint_interval` OR
  `wal.checkpoint_tail_bytes` fires — the checkpoint is the unit of serving state. Writing one is refs-level work,
  so each `maintain` host checkpoints its own repositories.
- **Provenance for free**: every push and repack is a log entry; `walgit wal ls|show|materialize --at-seq`.
- **Never LIST on a hot path**; 404s are free; probe, don't list. Immutable objects get
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` + strong ETag + Range everywhere (D10 static contract).

### 2.5 Pack lifecycle (WAL + git), leader by lease
- Assigned maintainers classify committed packs, fold compatible fresh families geometrically, freeze
  buffers by size or settlement, and re-segment by frozen-byte ratios under `leases/compact.pb`.
  Classification and coverage repair do not rewrite ordinary scoped push packs. Folds incorporate only
  geometrically comparable buffers; a large buffer does not move merely because enough tiny pushes arrived.
- History/blob families and retained indexed objects share one ordinary ODB. Inputs are copied into an
  isolated attempt under `<cache.dir>/_pack-lifecycle/`, with an owned reader pin and process lock.
  Disk-backed inventories preserve indexed objects, including unreachable objects; Git recomputes deltas
  from path-bearing object lists with explicit thread/window-memory limits. Full materialization and
  input/output headroom are required, so large jobs need sufficient disk placement.
- Plan/step receipts are disposable progress. Outputs publish additively; only the final seal retires
  exact captured inputs, rechecking live descriptors and policy on each CAS attempt. An overlapping
  output checksum stays live. Readers retain local files until their guards release. MIDX bitmaps over
  the readable inventory are verified before use. `walgit compact --base` forces the same conserving cut.
- Superseded pack records and bucket bytes remain indefinitely for issued downloads; there is no timed GC knob.

### 2.5b Self-healing by construction (D22)
Everything the maintainer produces — checkpoints, compactions, integrity work and retention — derives from
(config, WAL state). Each pass performs bounded useful work as a narrated task under the applicable lease.
There are no bundle schedules or separate base-rebuild engine. Missing coverage requests proof repair,
not a full cut; URI delivery remains a separately gated layer.

### 2.6 Packfile delivery target (D42)

[The packfile design](docs/PACKFILE_URI_DESIGN.md) replaces scheduled bundle wrappers with reusable ordinary
packs selected during fetch. Exact current-policy group certificates and captured snapshots must prove every
subtracted root, with complete same-generation dependencies and live checks on every CAS attempt. Metadata
stays outside normal code delivery; retained indexed objects survive maintenance. Static URLs require read
authorization plus exact live/retired membership. Retired downloads do not expire arbitrarily.

The native v2 path delivers proven URI packs for anonymous-read clients; gix/remote engines stay dynamic.
Protected clients retain dynamic fallback pending independent authenticated-client qualification. Discovery
uses `refs.advertise`; v2 mirrors request `server-option=ref-view=all` for complete ordinary refs. Static pack
and index GET/HEAD require read auth and fresh live/retired membership. Never subtract synthetic haves on a
path that does not emit their URLs. See [migration gates](docs/PACKFILE_MIGRATION.md) before changing durable writers.

### 2.7 Tasks, progress, narration (`walgit-wal/src/tasks.rs`, `crates/walgit-server/src/sse.rs`, `smart.rs`)
Any long work = a task: unique id, per-instance log (`GET …/tasks`), `(repo, kind)` lock (a second start joins),
replayable packet stream (`GET …/tasks/{id}`). Packets: `notice`, `progress {label,done,total?,unit,percent?}`,
`task`, terminal `result` | `error`. Web: any JSON endpoint that cannot answer immediately streams the SSE
envelope when the client accepts `text/event-stream`; fast answers stay plain cacheable JSON. Git: v2 `fetch`
advertises `sideband-all` and narrates on band 2 (`remote: * …`). Startup: `cache.prewarm` repos run a `prewarm`
task; `/readyz` is 503 until done or `prewarm_ready_timeout`. `no-progress` is honoured.

## 3. Principles (what a PR is judged against)

One idea: **the bucket is the repository; everything else is a cache or a reader of the log.** Ten consequences.
A change that feels natural on a conventional git host (a table, a queue, a cache server, a webhook from the push
path, a bigger disk) is usually a violation here. A violation means the principle is wrong — amend it with a
decision in §4 — or the PR is; never "fix later".

| # | Principle | The tell in a PR | The question to answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **I** | **No state outside the object store.** Disk and memory are caches. | A database, Redis, SQLite, a file that must survive a restart, an env var that encodes data. | "If every instance is wiped now, what is lost?" — must be "warmth". |
| **II** | **The manifest CAS is the only commit point.** Immutable objects are never overwritten (`PutMode::Overwrite` only on the manifest, leases, fsck.pb, events/cursor, maintainer heartbeats, render cache). | A second "commit" (a flag file, a list update that makes data visible), an ACK before the bucket's. | "What does a client on another instance see between the PUT and the CAS?" — nothing new. |
| **III** | **Side effects are readers of the WAL, never steps of a write.** Events, mirrors, notifications tail the log from a durable cursor. | A webhook/HTTP call from `receive.rs`, `publish.rs`, `follow.rs`, `smart.rs`. | "If this side effect fails, does the push?" — no. "Is it replayable from the cursor?" — yes. |
| **IV** | **Every read revalidates; there is no eventually.** | A cache that outlives the manifest's generation, a TTL invented for a repo-scoped answer, a read that skips `sync_*`. | "After `push` returns `ok`, can any instance serve the old state?" (`cargo test -p walgit-server --test sim`). |
| **V** | **Serve from the parts that fit; never a bigger box, never a hard-coded host.** | "Just download the pack", a path that assumes the full pack set is local, a hostname in `crates/` or `web/`. | "What happens to this code on a 20 GiB tmpfs with a 32 GB base pack? Which sync level does it need?" |
| **VI** | **Never block the async runtime; bulk bytes never share a lane with the control plane.** | `Command::new(...).output()` or `std::fs` big reads in an `async fn` outside `spawn_blocking`/the bulk runtime; a queued writer on `RepoHandle::rw` from an install path. | "On which thread does this run, and what holds `sync_mutex`/`rw` while it does?" (e2e `blocking_work_in_the_install_path_does_not_stall_requests`). |
| **VII** | **No LIST on a hot path; count the round trips.** | A `.list(` in request handling; a new GET "just to check"; a protocol change without a `docs/ROUNDTRIPS.md` row. | Before/after depth in the commit; the sim asserts request budgets (`FaultStore::stats().ops`). |
| **VIII** | **Standalone first; the edge announces, the app never assumes.** | Reading an `X-Walgit-*` request header without checking `X-Walgit-Capabilities`; a feature only testable behind nginx. | "Does this work on `walgit.standalone.toml` with nothing in front?" |
| **IX** | **No silent waiting.** | A new op that blocks a handler, a loop without a task, a `sleep` a client would wait on. | "Where does the client see this taking time?" — a task kind, a progress packet or a band-2 line. |
| **X** | **Keep walgit small.** Upstream `git` does git things; gix only where measured faster and correct; one config file, one auth story, one SDK; scope is `GOAL.md §4`. Proto append-only. | A new dependency without a why; a reimplementation of something `git` does; an alias/shim/"legacy" branch; a removed proto field. | "Which line of GOAL §4 is this for?" |

## 4. Decisions (append, never silently change)

D42 supersedes every bundle-specific runtime statement below, including D2/D9/D11/D17/D19/D21/D22/D24/D26/D29/D41.
Those statements are retained as decision history, not active configuration or implementation guidance.
Unrelated constraints remain in force. The current design target and migration gates are linked in §0.
- **D1** Rust, tokio + axum, HTTP/2 (h2c or ALPN), streaming both ways, gzip request bodies.
- **D2** gix in-process where it is correct and measured; upstream `git` for delta-compressing repack/bitmaps,
  bundle creation, and normal upload-pack. **`git.upload_pack_engine = "auto"` selects stock git wherever it can
  read the packs** (local copies or mount-linked bases); gix handles only a remote-served base. **The gix engine
  never emits thin packs** (`upload_gix.rs`): gix-pack's thin-pack path builds the base pack's whole (offset → oid)
  table per chunk per thread (60 M entries × 44 threads ⇒ 178 GB RSS) and is the only place gix writes an object id
  into a pack (a mid-pack refresh once paired offsets with another pack's table ⇒ a wrong id). The gix pack source
  is a frozen snapshot (`frozen_pack_source`). Reproducer: `walgit-git/tests/upload_gix_scale.rs`.
- **D3** `ObjectStore` trait with CAS version tokens, conditional GET, range, compose; gcs/s3/memory backends.
  `compose` is native on GCS and a multipart `UploadPartCopy` on S3 (`compose_is_native` tells callers which);
  `accel_target` gives an edge a URL (+ bearer on GCS, presigned on S3) to fetch an object itself.
- **D4** protobuf on the wire and in the bucket; schema versioned, append-only.
- **D5** Repo identity `<owner>/<repo>[.git]`, prefix `repos/<o>/<r>/`, creation = CAS create of the manifest.
- **D6** Manifest CAS is the only commit point. **D7** No node identity, no elections; leases for exclusivity.
- **D8** `walgit.toml` only (+ `WALGIT__` env overrides). **D9** One binary, roles by config (`serve`,
  `maintain`, `events`; `maintain` includes compaction and bundles).
- **D10** One static-serving code path for every immutable byte (ETag/304/If-Range/Range/416/HEAD/immutable;
  UI assets precompressed at build; store objects never compressed at request time).
- **D11** Too-large repos are served, not refused: remote reader for the web API; clones via bundle-uri; refs from
  the WAL. Object work returns 503 when remote objects are disabled or the repository is excluded from this host's
  serving placement (D30).
- **D12** Auth is `none` | `token` | `oidc` (§1.3). `oidc` is generic OpenID Connect through discovery; the
  walgit-issued access token (`wgt_…`, HMAC, stateless, `/_auth/tokens`) is the credential git uses, so no client
  needs a vendor CLI to mint tokens. An edge that wants to do auth itself uses `auth_request /_auth/check`
  (`deploy/nginx.conf.example`).
- **D13** Long work is a task and is narrated (§2.7); no endpoint may block silently.
- **D14** Web toolchain: pnpm + Vite only. The build fails unless the optimized SPA artefacts are present.
- **D15** Repo-scoped API lives at `/{o}/{r}/api/…` (refs, resolve, tree, blob, commits, commit, overview, ops,
  tasks, policy, settings) so the repository prefix determines placement. The browser lane is
  `/{o}/{r}/api-browser/…`; `/api/v1` is non-repository discovery, identity and owner listing. No aliases.
- **D16** Push authorization is a per-repo **rule language** at `repos/<o>/<r>/policy.json` (`docs/POLICY.md`).
  Envelope `version` + `groups` + `rules`; `protect` = AND. Empty/missing = anyone with write may move any ref.
- **D17 (historical; superseded by D42)** `bundles.require` refuses only **unbounded** zero-have fetches (no `deepen*`, no `filter`): that is a
  full clone and belongs to bundle-uri. Bounded zero-have fetches (CI's `--depth`/`--filter`) go to upload-pack.
  git never retries a failed bundle download and then falls back to a zero-have fetch; a principal that fetched
  the repo's `bundles/list` within the hour gets **one upload-pack full clone per 6 h** with a loud band-2
  WARNING; everyone else is refused with the truthful message.
- **D18** **History pack**: a tier-2 base is published with a derived `pack-objects --filter=blob:none` pack
  (commits + trees; `PackRef.kind = HISTORY`, `derived_from = <base>`) that every instance keeps as a real local
  pack; blob bytes are all that cross the mount / range reads. Superseded with its base.
- **D19** **The serving runtime is untouchable.** (1) control-plane store objects (manifest, log, checkpoints,
  leases, bundle list, policy, render cache) never share a transport or a permit with bulk bytes (packs, idx,
  side-files, bundles, LFS, ranged reads: their own pools under `store.gcs.bulk_concurrency`); (2) pack
  materialization never runs on the serving runtime (`sync::on_bulk_runtime`) and never queues as a writer on
  `RepoHandle::rw` — the refs phase needs only `sync_mutex`, pack removal is `try_write()` (a queued writer on a
  tokio RwLock blocks every new reader; one 24-minute clone once starved every info/refs for minutes).
- **D20** **One API, two lanes, one SDK**: `/{o}/{r}/api/…` accepts a bearer or the same-origin session;
  `/{o}/{r}/api-browser/…` is the cross-origin browser lane (`credentials: "include"`, CORS only for
  `server.cors_origins`, sign-in popup at `/api-browser/v1/authenticate`). The SDK **`repos.js`**
  (`web/sdk/repos.ts`; IIFE registers `window.repos`, ESM `repos.mjs`) maps the whole surface, picks the lane,
  does the popup dance and unwraps the SSE envelope; served at `/repos.js` (open, so a `<script>` tag can load it).
  **Dogfood rule**: the bundled UI is built on the SDK (`web/src/api.ts` is an adapter); fix the SDK, never fork.
- **D21 (historical; superseded by D42)** **No monthly bundle layer.** git's `creationToken` heuristic never walks past a full bundle; two layers
  of incrementals (daily, hourly) under one full (weekly) is the shape. Incrementals without `chain` list only
  their 2 newest per strategy (the second so a client that read the list a slot ago never 404s mid-chain);
  **`chain = true`** cuts a slot on the strategy's own previous bundle while that is newer than the newest base
  bundle — every slot since the base is wanted and kept, each exactly its delta. **Dailies are chained by
  default**; hourlies stay on the newest daily with 2 kept. `slots::base_for_incremental` is the one place that
  knows either rule.
- **D22 (historical; superseded by D42)** **Bundles are cut on calendar slots, main-only, as-of-slot, with a contiguous chain**
  (the former bundle design): a 6-field UTC cron `schedule` whose fire time *is* the slot; missing full
  slots backfilled oldest-first (`backfill_max`); content is main as of the highest WAL seq with `created_at ≤
  slot`; `creationToken = slot epoch`; prerequisites = tips of the newest `base` bundle at or before the slot;
  retention = `keep` fulls + the chain under them; refs default to `HEAD` + `refs/heads/main` for
  `bundles.main_only` repos (+ `extra_refs`).
- **D23** **An edge is optional and load-bearing only for bytes.** An nginx in front may terminate TLS, cache one
  `auth_request` verdict per credential, route by `/<owner>/<repo>`, and offload static bytes by `X-Accel-Redirect`
  — only when it injects `X-Walgit-Capabilities: accel-redirect`; the app's answer supplies `X-Walgit-Store-Url` /
  `-Authorization` / `-Key` and the edge slices and caches. `deploy/nginx.conf.example` is the reference; nothing
  in `crates/` knows a hostname.
- **D24** **Per-repo settings live in the WAL.** `RepoSettings {toml, revision, author, updated_at, message}` — a
  TOML document restricted to `[bundles]`, `[maintenance]`, `[compaction]`, `[upstream]` (≤ 16 KiB) — is published
  as a `SETTINGS` log entry **and inline on `manifest.pb`** (every refs-level sync sees the effective config at no
  extra round trip). Effective config = host `walgit.toml` ⊕ env ⊕ settings (`Config::with_settings`). Validated at
  publish; invalid = 400, nothing published. Surface: `GET|PUT|DELETE /{o}/{r}/api/settings`, `…/effective`,
  `…/history`; `walgit repo settings show|set|clear|history`. Not in settings: auth, store, server, wal, cache,
  `upstream.token_env` (host-only). `GET …/effective` returns only those sections. PUT/DELETE of settings and of
  `policy.json` require an **admin** principal (`tokens[].admin`, or oidc `admin_emails`/`admin_domains`;
  `mode = none` is admin on loopback). Write is push, not admin.
- **D25** **Two cache modes.** `cache.mode = "budget" | "disk" | "auto"` (auto = disk when `maintenance.disk =
  "ssd"`); in **disk** mode `cache_budget_bytes()` is 0 = unlimited — every repo fully local, never the
  too-large/remote/link path, eviction only under disk pressure (`cache.disk_high_watermark`, idle-oldest first).
- **D26** **Routing is by repo prefix, nothing else.** Everything whose path starts with `/<owner>/<repo>` (git
  smart HTTP, `.git` suffix, bundles, LFS, `/{o}/{r}/api*`, `/{o}/{r}/settings`, the SPA pages) is one routing
  unit; an edge maps `^/<o>/<r>[./?]` → a host. "Which machine serves a repo" is decidable from the first path
  segments alone (the `Server` header shows it). **D27** Lanes are a segment *after* the repo prefix
  (`/api`, `/api-browser`); the prefix is still the only routing key.
- **D28** **The host that maintains a repo is its writer.** Forwarding receive-pack to a broker
  (`wal.push_broker_url` + `push_broker_token`) is for hosts that maintain nothing. A `maintain` host refuses a push
  for a repo it does not `assigned()` (band-2 line + `ng`). Publish is CAS-safe, so two writer hosts for two
  disjoint repo sets is correct by construction; the broker is an optimisation.
- **D29** **An edge's fallback for a placed repo is read-only and refs-level.** GETs (info/refs, API, UI, bundle
  list, bundles) may fall back to another host; git RPC and LFS writes have no fallback and get **503 +
  `Retry-After: 15`** — a replayed POST either hangs or warms the wrong host while the client sees nothing.
- **D30** **Placement is configured, not inferred.** `[placement] serve / serve_exclude / maintain /
  maintain_exclude` (globs). A host that does not **serve** a repo answers its object work with **503 +
  `Retry-After: 15`** and a pkt-line `ERR walgit: <repo> is served by <host>; retry shortly` *before* any sync;
  refs-level reads stay available everywhere. **maintain** gates the maintainer loop.
  Test: `host_excluded_from_serving_a_repo_refuses_object_work_with_503`.
- **D31** **Draining must not stop serving.** *Phase 1* (SIGTERM): the maintenance loop starts no new unit and
  the running unit is **interrupted at once** (D22 redoes it; a unit too expensive to redo is made resumable —
  `BaseRebuild`) while the instance serves everything normally, `/readyz` 200; bounded 30 s. *Phase 2*:
  `/readyz` 503 + Retry-After, new fetch/push/LFS refused with 503 before any work, in-flight requests get
  `server.drain_timeout`, exit. Test `tests/drain.rs`.
- **D32** **Events are produced from the WAL by one small service, never by the push path** (`docs/EVENTS.md`).
  The **events bridge** (`roles=["events"]`) tails each repo's log from a durable per-repo cursor
  (`events/cursor.json`), converts committed PUSH/REF_UPDATE entries to `ref` events, POSTs each batch to
  `events.webhook_url` (JSON array; `X-Walgit-Delivery` = sha1 of the body; `X-Walgit-Signature: sha256=<HMAC>`
  when `webhook_secret` is set), advances the cursor: published iff durable, a crash loses nothing, lag =
  `head_seq − cursor`. Writers and the WAL crate contain no event code. Wake-ups: `POST /_events/notify` from a
  bucket notification (at-least-once) + a periodic sweep as backstop. Dedup key `(repo, seq, ref_name)`.
- **D33** **A repository's refs can follow an upstream git host, through the WAL, by its maintainer.**
  `[upstream] follow = ["refs/heads/main"]` (needs `upstream.git`; `upstream.token_env` names the env var with the
  token) makes the maintaining host fetch the delta every `maintenance.follow_interval` and publish it as an
  ordinary PUSH entry (`principal = upstream`), fast-forward only; policy is not evaluated (follow is
  configuration). Its own loop, never a unit of the priority loop. `walgit mirror` is the same operation from a
  host without the repo local, pushing over HTTP.
- **D39** **walgit is a standalone program; any deployment is packaging.** `walgit-server --config x.toml` (a thin
  bin = `walgit serve`; `walgit` with no subcommand serves too) works on one machine against one bucket with
  nothing in front of it. (1) **TLS in-process** — `[server.tls] mode = off | self_signed | files`; self-signed
  certs are generated once under `<cache.dir>/tls/`, published at `/services/public/ca.pem`, pinned for git by the
  installer. (2) **Everything an upstream might take over is announced by the upstream, per request, in
  `X-Walgit-Capabilities`** — never assumed. (3) `cache.dir` defaults to `/tmp/walgit`. (4) A missing `--config`
  file is fatal (exit 2); `--config /dev/null` is the explicit defaults+env form. (5) The credential helper and
  token file are host-derived (`<host>-credential-helper`, `<host>-token`) so two walgit hosts coexist on one machine.
- **D41 (historical; superseded by D42)** **Bundles: chained dailies, a clone list and a catch-up list, the chain through the weekly.** Dailies
  are cut on their predecessor (`chain = true`, default), hourlies on the newest daily (2 kept); at the tie between
  Sunday's daily and the weekly the chain continues through its own link, so Monday's daily has the weekly's tips
  as prerequisites without being cut on it; retention keeps the chain under every kept full. `bundles/list` (fulls
  + chain) is for clones, **`bundles/catchup`** (no fulls) is what recipes record in `fetch.bundleURI`. Measured: a
  catch-up is exactly the slots missed; for a client fetching several times a day, upload-pack's thin pack is
  smaller than an hourly bundle — bundles pay off for fresh clones and far-behind clients.

- **D42 (2026-09-11): Replace bundle runtime with negotiated reusable packs, in reviewed stages.**
  Migration: remove bundle crate/command/routes/protocol/schedules/config/cache/recipes now;
  ordinary dynamic clone/fetch remain. [PACKFILE_URI_DESIGN.md](docs/PACKFILE_URI_DESIGN.md) is the replacement
  target, not a claim that its later layers are wired. Independent code/meta groups, conserving history/blob
  lifecycle, exact captured coverage/dependencies, CAS revalidation and authenticated live/retired membership
  gate static emission. Retired URI records/bytes have no time or count cap. All engines must either deliver
  selected URLs or avoid synthetic subtraction. Protected stock clients retain dynamic fallback until a
  distributable authenticated client is independently verified. Durable protobuf numbers/messages remain
  append-only/replayable; old bundle runtime objects are not read/written. Host config and new settings reject
  obsolete bundle keys. A durable-only settings transition may explicitly remove the obsolete bundle table,
  warn and preserve supported overrides/raw history; it must never invent a wider ref/packing policy.
  [PACKFILE_MIGRATION.md](docs/PACKFILE_MIGRATION.md) defines compatible-writer rollout and evidence gates;
  no bucket deletion is part of this change. D42 overrides bundle-specific parts of earlier decisions only.

- **D43 (2026-09-11): Coverage and retirement authority lives in the manifest.** Named packing groups and
  advertisement selectors are independent policies; group kinds grant no access. Canonical content-addressed
  ref snapshots bind certificates to an exact captured generation. Every classification/compaction CAS checks
  current policy, live members and same-generation dependencies; stale certificates lose eligibility without
  deleting their objects. Retired checksums remain recorded indefinitely. Checkpoint metadata uses unique
  attempt keys and commits the exact refs key; old checkpoints resolve their original committed descriptor.
  Producers capture manifest, CAS token, refs and validated settings coherently. Invalid saved packing policy
  fails coverage capture instead of substituting host defaults. Stop incompatible writers before the new
  writer runs: older binaries do not enforce format-version fencing. This foundation alone does not emit URLs
  or prove object conservation; those require the lifecycle and transport layers described in D42.

- **D44 (2026-09-11): One pack lifecycle configuration replaces compaction knobs.** `[packs]` owns
  geometric factor/count/proportional bytes/age, minimum two fold inputs, size/settlement freeze, frozen-share
  and re-segmentation ratios, target segment size, and bounded delta-search resources. The default 2 GiB is
  a Git target, not an absolute bound on an oversized object. Resolve an explicit CPU-bounded thread count
  and divide the host-clamped whole-operation window-memory budget before invoking Git. Native Git is the
  only producer, so there is no engine selector. GNU sort/comm are runtime dependencies. Classification and
  proof repair stay separate from expensive re-segmentation; a missing certificate does not justify a cut.
  Host/new settings reject `[compaction]`. Saved bucket records alone may map enabled/factor/count/lease
  fields and omit the old Git-only engine; any saved flat trigger or retention timeout disables pack work
  with an explicit warning until an administrator rewrites settings. Conflicting old/new sections fail;
  other overrides and raw history survive. Ordinary serving remains available. This supersedes older
  compaction-configuration and timed pack-retention guidance, while lifecycle and URI evidence gates in
  D42/D43 remain required. [Migration details](docs/PACKFILE_MIGRATION.md).

- **D45 (2026-09-12): Conserving maintenance uses one staged lifecycle.** The current §2.5
  supersedes the single-base rebuild and separate geometric producer descriptions in D18/D31.
  Existing derived history packs remain readable durable data. New grouped history is authoritative,
  not a disposable accelerator. Preserve the full indexed input set through retained families,
  commit outputs additively, and retire exact inputs only at the final manifest CAS. Verify local
  MIDX/bitmap identity and traversal; remote engines retain ordinary traversal when pack bytes are
  absent. Shared code/meta objects may occupy one physical checksum with both memberships; code
  eligibility still requires exact code-group proof. Scratch receipts and locks cannot establish
  durable authority. This layer does not certify negotiated delivery, protected clients, model
  refinement, or large-repository resource/performance acceptance.

- **D46 (2026-09-12): Native URI delivery and discovery have separate gates.** Normal discovery uses
  `refs.advertise`; explicit v2 `ref-view=all` preserves mirror/backup access to ordinary auxiliary refs.
  Receive-pack remains complete. Only native Git may subtract selected roots; gix and remote dispatch happen
  first and remain dynamic. Selection uses exact captured certificates and one shared three-snapshot budget;
  size/count limits cannot discard required companions. URI encoding is non-thin. Static pack/index routes
  revalidate live/retired membership after ordinary read auth, and protected responses use private caching.
  `packfile-indexes` is an explicit optional wire extension, not proof of authenticated-client compatibility.
  Protected dynamic fallback remains until a distributable client is qualified. No version-label heuristic,
  anonymous exposure of protected packs, `.rev` transfer, arbitrary-want coverage guess or full-clone refusal
  knob is introduced. Large narrated dynamic clones warn. Scale and model/code mapping gates remain open.

Decision identifiers are stable; gaps in the numbering are intentional.

- **D47 (2026-09-12): Publication evidence and receipts are exact.** A no-op ref submission with no
  new pack reports success at seq 0 without creating history; an empty-ref pack-only push rejects. A
  rejected submission reports rejection for every command. Each immutable log claim carries a fresh
  reserved `walgit.publication_nonce`; exact bytes, not key/sequence alone, resolve a lost CAS reply.
  Missing evidence stays `CommitUnknown`. Buffered forwarding falls back only before delivery;
  ambiguous transport and gateway replies never trigger local replay. Disable broker redirects and
  automatic transport retries. Bounded models and their precise controls run in CI; the
  [code/test map](docs/spec/README.md) records unproved boundaries and remaining corrections.

---

- **D48 (2026-09-12): Cache evidence and readiness.**

Remote index admission verifies index checksum, pack checksum identity and known descriptor size/count,
including reused installed links. Repair installs a fresh inode. A repository-local kernel lock protects
cache names across processes until callers own opened mappings or independent links; blocking workers keep
the lock through cancellation. Temporary names belong to one attempt, and abandoned names are reclaimed
only while holding the lock. This local ownership is disposable cache coordination, never publication
truth. Carry pack readiness only from a proven matching inventory; inherited nonempty caches reconcile on
open, including manifest changes that advance revision without adding a log entry. Small downloads reject
short or oversized bodies. These checks do not replace the required per-CAS closure proof or establish the
full cold-read/resource acceptance gates listed in `docs/spec/README.md`.

- **D49 (2026-09-12): Final retirement re-proves indexed conservation.** Capture manifest/token/refs
  together on every seal attempt, verify the exact current indexes, and merge input/output OID streams
  with one cursor per pack. Every indexed input object must survive in the declared outputs, and every
  current tip must appear in the resulting live inventory before the log claim/CAS. Raw producer admission
  and candidate external-boundary proof remain separate obligations; local loose objects and retired
  download membership cannot justify retirement. See the cost and remaining-evidence rows in the linked docs.

## 5. Working rules

- **No backwards compatibility (pre-1.0, banner at top):** change the shape and delete the old one in the same
  commit — no aliases, shims, deprecated routes/keys/fields. Only bucket formats (WAL, manifest, log, checkpoint
  protos) stay append-only/replayable.
- Keep this file current: append decisions with a number and a date; never delete history, replace it with the
  decision that superseded it.
- **Never block the async runtime**: no blocking git/fs work (repack, midx, commit-graph, gix reopen, large
  reads/copies) on a tokio worker — `spawn_blocking`; every `refresh()` on an async path is `refresh_async()`. Pack
  materialization runs on the **bulk runtime** (`sync::on_bulk_runtime`). The runtime watchdog logs "async runtime
  stalled" with `inflight` and `tasks_running`: `inflight = 0` at a late tick ⇒ the platform paused the process,
  `inflight > 0` ⇒ a real stall — look at `lock_wait_max_ms` and `walgit_lock_wait_seconds{lock}`. Bulk bytes never
  share a transport with the control plane (`store.gcs.bulk_clients`, `bulk_concurrency`).
- **Correct is not sufficient.** Every protocol change (publish, sync, leases, checkpoints, pack delivery) is also
  judged on critical-path round trips against the bucket — read `docs/ROUNDTRIPS.md`, update its budget table, put
  before/after depth in the commit, keep verification on the failure path, assert request budgets in the sim.
- **Standalone first (D39):** a feature must work with walgit hit directly (no edge, in-process TLS, bytes
  streamed by walgit). Anything an edge takes over is announced per request in `X-Walgit-Capabilities`; never
  infer an edge from config, never hardcode a hostname in `crates/` or `web/`.
- **S3 and GCS are both first class.** Every store feature has both implementations and runs in the contract
  suite (`just test-s3` against rustfs, `just test-gcs <bucket>`); "GCS only" is a bug.
- **Use the rig before prod** (`just dev-store` → `walgit-server --config walgit.standalone.toml`). Exercise
  ordinary clone/fetch and bounded maintenance against the rig before testing on large repositories.
- No new auth paths (§1.3). No LIST on hot paths. No unbounded buffering of packs in memory. No full
  materialization above `cache.max_bytes` in budget mode. No silent long operations (make it a task, narrate it).
- Every immutable response: `immutable` + strong ETag + Range; every ref-dependent response: SWR + ETag.
- Before changing the wire/store formats: proto is append-only; manifests/log entries must stay replayable by
  old readers within the retention window.
- Web: pnpm + Vite, `pnpm run build` must pass oxlint/tsc. Config: `walgit.example.toml` documents every key;
  change it with the code.
- Test tiers: `just test` (fast, < 1 min), `just e2e`, `just warnings`, `just clippy` (the
  `[workspace.lints]` set, `-D warnings`), `just ci` = all four plus `just sim` and `just smoke`; the **simulation
  suite** `cargo test -p walgit-server --test sim` (fault links per instance over one truth store: crash,
  partition, stale, lost response, orphan scenarios + randomized seeds `WALGIT_SIM_SEEDS`/`WALGIT_SIM_SEED`);
  `just test-slow` (ignored benches); `tests/e2e.sh` against a running server (`WALGIT_E2E_BASE_URL`,
  `WALGIT_TOKEN`). Never `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast` in a session; wrap ad-hoc cargo in `timeout`.
- Known flaky (find the cause, not the assertion): `fetch_from_front_that_serves_the_base_remotely` (~1 in 3
  under the full e2e suite: base published without `has_commit_graph`) and
  `sim::base_rebuild_resumes_after_a_kill_between_any_two_phases` (~1 in 7, shared `TEST_ABORT_AFTER`). Both
  pass alone.
